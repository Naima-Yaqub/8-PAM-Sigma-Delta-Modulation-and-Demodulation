# 8-PAM Sigma-Delta Modulation and Demodulation

This project presents a MATLAB-based simulation of an **8-Pulse Amplitude Modulation (8-PAM) communication system** using **Sigma-Delta modulation and demodulation** techniques. The system is modeled end-to-end, from signal generation at the transmitter to signal reconstruction at the receiver, with a focus on analyzing the impact of oversampling and noise shaping on signal quality.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of digital modulation, oversampling, and reconstruction methods commonly used in modern communication systems and data converters.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To implement an 8-PAM modulation scheme in MATLAB
- To apply Sigma-Delta modulation for digital-to-analog conversion
- To analyze the role of oversampling and noise shaping in signal reconstruction
- To evaluate system performance using RMS error analysis
- To visualize signals at different stages of modulation and demodulation

## System Description and Methodology

The communication system is implemented as a sequence of processing blocks:

### 1. Input Signal and 8-PAM Modulation
A discrete-time input signal is generated and mapped onto **8-PAM symbols**, where each symbol represents one of eight possible amplitude levels. This forms the digitally modulated baseband signal.

### 2. Oversampling
The 8-PAM signal is oversampled to increase time resolution. Oversampling is a key requirement for Sigma-Delta modulation, as it enables effective noise shaping and improves reconstruction accuracy.

### 3. Sigma-Delta Modulation (DAC Stage)
A Sigma-Delta modulator is applied to the oversampled signal to convert it into a high-rate, low-resolution bitstream. This stage pushes quantization noise outside the signal band, making it easier to suppress during reconstruction.

### 4. Channel Modeling
A simplified channel model is applied to represent transmission and system imperfections. This allows observation of how the modulated signal behaves under non-ideal conditions.

### 5. Sigma-Delta Demodulation and ADC
At the receiver, the bitstream is processed using a Sigma-Delta demodulator and low-pass filtering to reconstruct the original 8-PAM signal. The signal is then resampled to its original rate.

### 6. Performance Evaluation
The reconstructed signal is compared with the original input using **Root Mean Square (RMS) error**, providing a quantitative measure of system performance.

## Results and Observations

- The reconstructed signal closely follows the original 8-PAM signal, confirming correct modulation and demodulation.
- Oversampling combined with Sigma-Delta modulation significantly reduces in-band quantization noise.
- The Sigma-Delta demodulation and filtering stages successfully suppress high-frequency noise introduced during modulation.
- A low RMS error is observed, indicating accurate signal recovery at the receiver.
- Visual inspection of time-domain plots at different stages shows effective noise shaping and signal reconstruction.

These results highlight the effectiveness of Sigma-Delta techniques in high-resolution digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion for multilevel modulation schemes such as 8-PAM.
